A few weeks I joined [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com) and for the eagle-eyed you'd realise this is actually for the second time. Previously at Canonical I spent my days with the Mobile Team, realising the goal of a good Linux on ARM experience which eventually culminated in the foundation of [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org). This time I am equally excited about another formative stage of technology, that of IoT and the possibilities of interoperable and extensible devices running a standard Linux operating system.

I personally will be working directly on Snappy Core, the technology used to provide a stable, secure, transactional, and featureful platform for the internet of things (IoT) and beyond. I believe in the future of IoT, big data, and a world full of Mark Weiser's vision of [Ubiquitous Computing](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html) and I am excited to be part of it.
